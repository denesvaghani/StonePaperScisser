# StonePaperScisser
Web Application of StonePaperScisser using Spring MVC.


I have created StonePaperScisser application which have 4 player bydefault and you can guess 50 times. It will shows results at each iteration.

If you want to change TotalPlayer then do change in StonePaperScisser.java file and change value of variable " totalPlayer ".
If you want to change guessing time then do change in GameLogic.java file and change value of variable " totalLimit ".
